## Overview

We designed and implemented a complete funnel strategy for **Las Alamedas**, a premium residential development. The focus was on generating qualified leads and accelerating lot sales using a landing-page-first approach, powered by paid traffic from Meta Ads and supported by automation.

## Key Features

- **Custom Landing Page**: A mobile-first, conversion-driven landing page designed specifically for high-ticket real estate leads, with strategic copy, social proof, and guided CTAs.
- **Meta Ads Strategy**: We launched segmented ad campaigns targeting ideal buyer profiles, with retargeting layers and A/B testing to improve ad relevance and CPL (Cost per Lead).
- **CRM Integration + WhatsApp Automation**: Leads were instantly funneled into a CRM and connected via WhatsApp to sales agents, dramatically reducing response time and increasing follow-up rates.
- **Data-Driven Optimization**: The funnel was tracked using Meta Pixel and event-based metrics, allowing real-time adjustments to improve conversion rates and ad performance.

## Technologies Used

- **ClickFunnels**: For landing page UI and performance tracking.
- **Meta Ads Manager**: To manage paid campaigns with custom audience segments.
- **Google Tag Manager + Meta Pixel**: To track events, opt-ins, and optimize campaign objectives.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was positioning a high-value real estate offer in a highly competitive region. We focused on building trust through testimonials, transparent pricing, and urgency-driven CTAs. Additionally, aligning ad strategy with sales follow-up workflows created a stronger close rate, proving the importance of full-funnel coordination.

## Outcome

The funnel drove exceptional results: **over 100 residential lots sold in less than a year**. The combination of ad targeting, landing design, and automation created a predictable, scalable sales engine that continues to deliver qualified prospects every month.
