## Overview

Embryogen is a fertility clinic specializing in IVF (in vitro fertilization). The clinic needed a high-converting funnel to attract qualified leads, build trust, and generate appointment bookings — all while navigating the sensitivity of fertility as a topic.

## Key Features

- **Tailored Landing Page**: Built a focused, mobile-first landing page for IVF services, structured around emotional resonance, clarity of pricing, and strong calls to action.
- **Meta Ads Strategy**: Launched conversion-focused campaigns with interest and behavior targeting specific to couples actively researching fertility treatments.
- **WhatsApp + CRM Automation**: Integrated instant WhatsApp follow-ups and CRM syncing to accelerate response times and improve lead nurturing.
- **Performance Tracking**: Pixel events and funnel tracking were used to evaluate opt-in rates and conversion flow in real time.

## Technologies Used

- **ClickFunnels**: For landing page UI and performance tracking.
- **Meta Ads Manager**: To execute segmented campaigns focused on high-intent IVF prospects.
- **Meta Pixel & Meta Conversions API**: For advanced conversion tracking.

## Challenges and Learnings

Fertility is a deeply personal topic — so the biggest challenge was creating a digital experience that felt trustworthy, warm, and medically reliable. We accomplished this by emphasizing real testimonials, doctor credentials, and supportive messaging. Ad campaigns were tested across various tones (emotional vs. informational) to find the optimal engagement model.

## Outcome

The campaign achieved a **50% opt-in rate** and generated **over 40 qualified appointment bookings per month**. Embryogen saw a significant improvement in lead quality, response times, and overall engagement with their IVF service funnel.
